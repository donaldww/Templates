# Templates Repository

Welcome to the **Templates** repository! This project is designed to be a central hub for:

- **Zsh configurations**: Custom `.zshrc` files, plugin setups, aliases, functions, and other shell productivity enhancements.
- **Project scaffolding**: Boilerplate files and templates to quickly bootstrap new programming projects across various languages and frameworks.

## Contents

### 1. Zsh Configurations

This section contains curated Zsh configuration files and scripts, including:

- Custom `.zshrc` templates for different workflows
- Useful aliases and functions for development

These configurations are aimed at improving your command-line efficiency and making your shell environment more powerful and enjoyable.

### 2. Project Scaffolding

As the repository evolves, it will include scaffolding files and templates for:

- Common project structures (e.g., Python, Node.js, Go, Rust, etc.)
- Standardized README templates
- Boilerplate configuration files (e.g., `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, CI/CD configs)
- Starter scripts and Makefiles

The goal is to help you start new projects with best practices and minimal setup time.
